Make sure you have read the [documentation regarding installing and setting up a PostGIS-enabled database](!SITE.GITHUB!/blob/gh-pages/setup.md#data-management-and-maps).

### Importing data to PostGIS

This map is comprised of two datasets - [district shapefiles](https://github.com/fwelections/tunisia-election-data/tree/master/shapes) and tabular [eligibility + registration data](https://github.com/fwelections/tunisia-election-data/blob/master/2011data/misc/Turnout.csv). To import the shapefiles see the [setup.md for instructions on importing geographic data](!SITE.GITHUB!/blob/gh-pages/setup.md#importing-geographic-data-to-postgis).


You're now ready to style your map in TileMill. Create a new project. In TileMill create a PostGIS layer following the [online documentation](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/postgis-work/), specifying the `eligibility` table.

Paste in the appropriate html for the and [tooltip](!SITE.GITHUB!/blob/gh-pages/map-src/tooltip-src.html) (labeled 'eligibility')  See the [Eligibility TileMill project](!SITE.GITHUB!/tree/gh-pages/map-src/eligibility) for CartoCss styles.
