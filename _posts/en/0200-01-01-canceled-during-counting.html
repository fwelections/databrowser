description: "<p>This map visualizes the prevalence of votes invalidated during counting rather than those ballots that were invalidated at polling centers. This shows the areas where more robust voter education efforts, or tactile ballots, could have the greatest impact.  Nationwide, the total number of cancelled ballots was under 4%. However, in some areas, mostly rural areas where illiteracy is high and, coincidentally, where unrest and discord is high, the number of cancelled ballots is much higher.</p>"

The map of [where cancelled votes came from](http://fwelections.github.com/databrowser/en/canceled-during-counting/) relies polling center data available as [individual `.json` files](https://github.com/fwelections/tunisia-election-data/tree/master/fulldatasets/results) that were provided as a two CSV tables - one containing latitude + longitude coordinates and the other containing detailed election data. 

NOTE: only 588 out of the 4,800 or so polling centers are currently visualized on the map. While election data has been collected for virtually all polling centers, location data (lat/lon coordinates) has only been collected for 588 polling centers. 

Make sure you have read the [documentation regarding installing and setting up a PostGIS-enabled database](!SITE.GITHUB!/blob/gh-pages/setup.md#data-management-and-maps) before proceeding any further.

### 1. Import data to PostGIS 

To set up the election data table run the following SQL: 

<pre>
create table results (
	circonscription_name text,
	circonscription_isieid int,
	delegation_name text,
	delegation_isieid int,
	centre_name text,
	centre_isieid int,
	bureau_name text,
	bureau_isieid numeric,
	registred_voters numeric,
	total_voters numeric,
	extracted_ballots numeric,
	delivered_ballots numeric,
	white_ballots numeric,
	not_used_ballots numeric,
	cancelled_ballots numeric,
	damaged_ballots numeric,
	valid_ballots numeric,
	list_name text,
	list_rank numeric,
	votes numeric,
	percentage numeric
);
</pre>

If you've parsed the `.json` files into a CSV you can import that CSV data by running the command 

<pre>
cat eligible_voters 2011data/election-results.csv | psql -d tunisia -c "COPY results FROM STDIN WITH DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER"
</pre>

We set up a separate table for the geometry with the following schema:

<pre>
create table pc (
	district_name_ar text,
	delegation_name_ar text,
	polling_center_name_ar text,
	latitude numeric,
	longitude numeric,
	contact text
	);
</pre>

<pre>
cat shapes/polling_centers_tunisia.csv | psql -d tunisia -c "COPY pc FROM STDIN WITH DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER"
</pre>

### 2. Aggregate Polling Center data + join to geometry 

The data is structured so that each record (row) represents a party on the ballot at each polling center. To effectively show how many ballots were cancelled at each polling center, we need to

- aggregate this data into statistics for each polling center. In addition to aggregating this data
- join to lat/lon data
- create a unique polling center id

This can be accomplished with the following query.

<pre>
create table pc_results as (
	select 
		a.district_name_ar,
 		a.delegation_name_ar,
 		a.polling_center_name_ar,
 		a.latitude,
 		a.longitude,
 		a.contact,
		b.circonscription_name,
		b.circonscription_isieid,
		b.delegation_name,
		b.delegation_isieid,
		b.centre_name,
		b.centre_isieid,
		b.id,
		b.registred_voters,
		b.total_voters,
		b.extracted_ballots,
		b.delivered_ballots,
		b.white_ballots,
		b.not_used_ballots,
		b.cancelled_ballots,
		b.damaged_ballots,
		b.valid_ballots,
		b.votes
	from pc a left join (
		select
			circonscription_name,
			circonscription_isieid,
			delegation_name,
			delegation_isieid,
			cast(cast(circonscription_isieid as text)||cast(delegation_isieid as text)||cast(centre_isieid as text) as int) as id,
			centre_name,
			centre_isieid,
			sum(registred_voters) as registred_voters,
			sum(total_voters) as total_voters,
			sum(extracted_ballots) as extracted_ballots,
			sum(delivered_ballots) as delivered_ballots,
			sum(white_ballots) as white_ballots,
			sum(not_used_ballots) as not_used_ballots,
			sum(cancelled_ballots) as cancelled_ballots,
			sum(damaged_ballots) as damaged_ballots,
			sum(valid_ballots) as valid_ballots,
			sum(votes) as votes
		from results 
		group by circonscription_name,circonscription_isieid,delegation_name,delegation_isieid,centre_name,centre_isieid
	) b
	on polling_center_name_ar = centre_name
);
</pre>

You can now use the `pc_results` table in the [canceled-votes tilemill project](!SITE.GITHUB!/tree/gh-pages/map-src/canceled) to style your data.
